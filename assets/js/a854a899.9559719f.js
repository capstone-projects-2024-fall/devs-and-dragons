Features include a chatbot assistance using Chat GPT\u2019s API to offer hints and guidance, without solving the problem for the user. It includes a point-based reward structure which will allow the user to earn gold and use it to customize their avatar. Group battles operate in a turn-based system where each participant is given set time to contribute. The group placement will be based on the performance of the user. By using this platform, users will have a collaborative way to improve their programming skills through personalized coding challenges."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,r.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Conceptual Design"})}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Our app will use a web-based architecture where the user data is sent to the backend using API calls through Flask.
